    <h3>Homework 1: Web Project Proposal</h3>
    <p>
        I have no previous database experience except for Microsoft Excel. 
    </p>
    <p>    
        I proposed to create a web application that allows users to register for 1 vs 1 E-Sport Tournament. 
        Click <a href="docs/Nguyen_3308_HW1.docx">here</a> to see a document that includes my proposed data model.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was not so challenging yet, but I knew everything will be later on because I have to learn how to work with both the web site and the database. 
    </p>


    <h3>Homework 2: Database</h3>
    <p>
        In this homework, I learned how to create tables in a relational database,  
        populate these tables, and select data from these tables. 
        Click <a href="docs/Nguyen_3308_HW2.docx">here</a> to see the document I submitted for this homework. 
        The homework was tricky because I made my associate table a bit too complex and so I had to fill everything in. I also had to learn how to select the columns in MySql using the correct SELECT statements.
    </p>

    <h3>Homework 3: Home Page</h3>
    <p>
        My web development/design experience consists of making resume web pages for my friend. I created the HTML structures so that my friend could fill out the contents, then used CSS to style the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
        The advanced CSS techniques I used for this homework were Box Shadowing and Transparency (using opacity).
    </p>
    <p>
        In this Homework, I learned how to create a home page that uses JavaScript to make 
        AJAX calls to read HTML partial files that get injected into the content area  
        (to achieve HTML code reuse). 
        I also learned about ColorZilla, a very helpful tool that lets me copy the color I want to select on the browser. Finally, I learned how to fix the nav bar and the footer to the top and bottom of my page using fixed positioning.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hardest part of this HW was to come up with a good home page design, and to avoid completely copying the given sample code by adding new ideas.
    </p>
    <h3>Homework 4: Display Data</h3>
    <p>
        In this Homework, I learned how to display the data from my database in my web page. I learned different techniques including implementing web APIs, tunneling, debugging, creating drop down nav bar, and deleting object properties.
        Click <a href="docs/Nguyen_3308_HW4.docx">here</a> to see the document I submitted for this homework. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It was easy to study the sample code and understand what it does. However, it was very hard for me to implement the APIs for other data in my database based on the given API. It was also hard for me to change the layout that the buildTable() method presented.
        I did not know how to display the image using the URL in my database in Java Script (I know how to do it in HTML, but I am using the CRUD.js files to inject the table contents to the index page, not HTML pages). <br>
        The TA gave me a -1 because "The link in the tournament table should be clickable". This was never mentioned in the homework requirements, nor it is in the example deduction. While I agree that it should be clickable (although I made all the links up just to make the tournaments realistic), I argue that my points should not be deducted because it was never a requirement. I realized I should have made everything as easy as possible and that way I lost 0 points.
    </p>
    <h3>Homework 5: Log on</h3>
    <p>
        In this Homework, I learned how to add log on functionality and allow users to view their profile when they are logged on. I learned how to get user input by using HTML &lt;input&gt; tags, how to send input to a Web API using URL parameters, how a Web API extracts the input from the URL parameters using request.getParameter("parameterName"), and how java code (safely) injects user input into a SQL statement by using the setString method of a java.sql.PreparedStatement object.
    </p>
    <p>
        The homework was overall challenging, because sample codes were not provided as much as in the previous homework. However, things got easier after I successfully displayed user info after the user logged in (which means I have successfully retrieved the data from logonAPI.jsp). Getting the API to work was the most important task in this homework. The next problem was to process and display what the API gives me after I put in the parameters.
    </p>
    <h3>Homework 6a: Insert User & Other data</h3>
    <p>
        In this Homework, I learned how to add insert functionality and allow users to create a new user & tournament data for my tournament website. I learned how to display the user roles as a pick list that users can choose from and how to validate user input fields, and also had a first-hand experience on how to use IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression). The TA gave me a -1 because he said "The tournament name must be unique". However, this was never mentioned in ANY of the homework we have done so far, nor it is in the example deduction. I can argue that if he looks up an online chess playing website, for example, there could be 1000 tournaments named "blitz" and they are all different tournaments. I did not make the tournament name unique from HW 3 but nobody said anything, and now he started to deduct point. Very suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
        The homework was not very hard, because sample codes for inserting users were provided and it was not hard to write the codes for inserting "other" table (no pick list required). The number of files I had to incorporate into my website was intimidating at first, but I understood how the files worked with one another after some trial-and-error methods. 
        The code I wrote in lab 6(a) was especially helpful because there were many fields in my "other" table, and I did not want to write all the validation code all over again.
    </p>
    <h3>Tutorial Proposal</h3>
    <p>
        I plan to create a framework that allows a pop-up modal to display an image slideshow, from which the user can view the images and select one as the background photo of the page.
I came up with this framework by combining different tutorials from w3schools.com (Modal Popup, Image Slideshow, CSS background-image property, etc.). In my current proof of concept code, the JavaScript functions work by injecting properties to CSS using the IDs provided by the DOM elements. The goal is to incorporate this framework into my own website, which is a gaming website and will look nicer if there are multiple background images to choose from.

    <h3>Homework 6b: Insert Associate</h3>
    <p>
        In this Homework, I expand the insert functionality to allow user to register to the tournaments on my website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The homework was harder than Homework 6a, but nothing was overwhelming. I had to add new String object to my registration StringData and had to change a lot of files to make the pick list work without affecting other functionalities. 
    </p>
    <h3>Tutorial (Complete)</h3>
    <p>To complete my tutorial, I had to convert most of the HTML code into JavaScript functions, so that the consumers can build their own pop-up slide show using few lines of code. I also change the styling from the previous demo file so that the new slide show looks nicer.</p>

    <h3>Homework 7: Delete</h3>
    <p>In this homework, I learned how to let user delete records from the database by invoking the appropriate SQL commands. In my website, users can delete records from web_user, tournament, and registration table.</p>
    <p>The homework was overall not difficult, as we have done most of the coding in lab 7.</p>
    <h3>Homework 8a: Update User & Other</h3>
    <p>In this homework, I learned how to let user update user & "other" records in the database by invoking the appropriate SQL commands. In my website, users can update records from web_user and tournament table. They do so by clicking on the update icon (pencil icon) when viewing the list of users and/or tournaments</p>
    <p>The homework was tricky, as I had to change and add in lots of files in many folders (HTML, JavaScript, JSP, Source Package, etc.). Updating tournaments was not as difficult as updating users because it does not require a pick list. However, the sample code was provided for updating users, so it actually took less time to work on that task. I imagine updating the associative table for the next homework could be more difficult because there will be 2 pick lists instead of 1.</p>
