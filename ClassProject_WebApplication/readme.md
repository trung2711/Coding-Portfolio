Web Application Project

This project is dedicated to program and design a single web application. The website is an esport tournament registration portal, which allows user to register, login, log out, see the list of tournaments and register for one or multiple tournaments, and cancel the registration.

Language used in this project: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java. The web folder contains the front-end coding and web APIs using JSP. The src folder contains backend code in Java.

There is also a side project included, which is an image slideshow created using JavaScript. The slideshow allows users to change the website's background image to the one they like.

The database used in the project belongs to Temple University. Outside user cannot access the database, so this project cannot be viewed locally.

The resulted website can be viewed here instead: http://cis-linux2.temple.edu:8080/SP19_3308_tug57907/index.html
