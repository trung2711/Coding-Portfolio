1. I used two very similar functions for Disk1 and Disk2. It could be improved by writing only one function to handle both disks. However, this might require a different variable handling & comparing method from my solution.

2. The QNode struct might not be needed to store event in the queue. At the time I thought it was a nice abstraction, but now I think the program can be simplified if I only used one struct (event) (Still, if you are a recruiter, at least I attempted to use abstraction).
