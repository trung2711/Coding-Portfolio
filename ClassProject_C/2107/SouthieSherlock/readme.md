Southie Sherlock

In this program, a text file containing the story of Sherlock Holmes is provided. The program then scan the text file and rewrite the story to another file (southie-sherlock.txt). The spelling rules in the text during the characters' quotes are changed to match the southern accents.

The original text file itself sometimes does not put the quotes inside quotation marks. I tried my best to catch all edge cases, but since quotes are only recognizable if they are between the quotation marks, the program will not work for some part of the text. This is due to the faulty original text and not because of the actual program.

While helping students work on this project in Java, I found out that this project is much easier in Java. Still, it was a fun challenge to do this in C.
