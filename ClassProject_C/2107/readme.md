Telephone Word Generator

Nowadays, many people remember company or service phone number as a 3-digit area code followed by 7 letters that represent the remaining numbers (E.g: (215) GETACAB).

The program ask for a 7-digit number that does not contain 0s and 1s. The program then either refuses invalid input (if number is less than 7 digits or contains 0s and/or 1s), or prints out to a text file all possible letter combinations of the number.

I made a brute force solution to this program using nested for-loops. There may be a better solution.
